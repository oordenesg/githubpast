# Magic 8-Ball

# This is a popular toy developed in 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. 
# We will write a Python program that can actually answer "Yes" or "No" questions given some questions.
# To do this we will 9 possible answers:

# 1. Yes - definitely.
# 2. It is decidedly so.
# 3. Without a doubt.
# 4. Reply hazy, try again.
# 5. Ask again later.
# 6. Better not tell you now.
# 7. My sources say no.
# 8. Outlook not so good.
# 9. Very doubtful.

# Let's create our 8-Ball program.

# 1. In magic8.py, declare a variable name and assign it to the name of the person who will be asking the Magic 8-Ball.

# 2. Now, declare a variable question, and assign to a “Yes” or “No” question you’d like to ask the Magic 8-Ball.


# 3. We want to store the answer of the Magic 8-Ball in another variable, which we’ll call answer. For now, assign this variable to an empty string.


# 4. Next, we’ll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called random_number, and assign it to the function call:

# 5. Now that we’ve declared all the variables needed, it’s time to implement the core logic of our program! For this section, we’ll be utilizing control flow using an if/elif/else statement to assign different answers for each randomly generated value.
# First, write an if statement where if the random_number is equal to 1, answer is assigned to the phrase “Yes - definitely.”. Then, continue writing elif statements for each of the remaining phrases for the values 3 to 9.


# 6. Now, let’s see our program in action! Write a print() statement to output the asker’s name and their question, which should be in the following format: Name + "asks:" + Question

# 7. Add a second print() statement that will output the Magic 8-Ball’s answer in the following format: Magic 8-Ball's answer: [answer]
