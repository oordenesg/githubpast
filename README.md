# How to Python

Python is one of the most useful programming languages due to its flexibility and speed. Currently, Python programming has become one of the most demanding professional skills. To start with this new languague, we can add our first line of code. 

```python
my_name = "New_student" ## My name
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!") ## Print the result
## Hello and welcome New_student!
```

As you saw previously, the code has two elements. The function or variables and comments. Using *#*, we are telling the computer to ignore that part of a program. So we can say that text written in a program but not run by the computer is called a comment. Another element in our previous code is the *print* function. In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to talk. The printed words that appear as a result of the *print* function are referred to as *output* of our program. 

In programming, computers refer to block of text as strings. In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes or single quotes like "Hello World" or 'Hellor World'.  

Using Python, we can store data for reuse. This is what we called a variable. In this programming laguangue, we assign variables by using the equal sign *=*. Let's see an example

```python
message_string = "Hello there"
# Prints "Hello there"
print(message_string)
```

If the context of a program changes, we can update a variable but perform the same logical process on it. Let's see how to update a variable. 

```python
# Greeting
message_string = "Hello there!!!"
print(message_string)
 
# Farewell
message_string = "Bye! Take care"
print(message_string)
```

When we create a program it is normal to make mistakes. Python refers to mistakes as *errors* and will point to the location where an error ocurred with a *^* character.  When programs throw errors that we didn't expect to encounter we call those *errors bugs*.  Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

- SyntaxError: Something is wrong with the way our program is written
- NameError: Ocurrs when Python interpreter a sees a word it does not recognize.

In general, computers can understand other types of data. One of the most relevant is *Numbers* and it has multiple ways of storing numbers. Within this data type, we can fin different types of data.  

1. An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, â€¦) as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0

2. A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements.

```python
# Define the release and runtime integer variables below:
release_year = 2009
runtime = 2
# Define the rating_out_of_10 float variable below: 
rating_out_of_10 = 7.6
```
