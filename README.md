# How to Python

Python is one of the most useful programming languages due to its flexibility and speed. Currently, Python programming has become one of the most demanding professional skills. To start with this new languague, we can add our first line of code. 

```python
my_name = "New_student" ## My name
print("Hello and welcome " + my_name + "!") ## Print the result
## Hello and welcome New_student!
```

As you saw previously, the code has two elements. The function or variables and comments. Using *#*, we are telling the computer to ignore that part of a program. So we can say that text written in a program but not run by the computer is called a comment. Another element in our previous code is the *print* function. In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to talk. The printed words that appear as a result of the *print* function are referred to as *output* of our program. 

In programming, computers refer to block of text as strings. In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes or single quotes like "Hello World" or 'Hellor World'.
