## School Catalogue

# We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, 
# each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

# 1. School
# Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (integer)
# Getters: all properties have getters
# Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
# Methods: A __repr__ method that displays information about the school.

# 2. Primary
# Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
# Properties: pickupPolicy (string, like "Pickup after 3pm")

# 3. Middle
#Does not include any additional properties or methods

# 4. High
#Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
#Properties: sportsTeams (list of strings, like ['basketball', 'tennis'])
