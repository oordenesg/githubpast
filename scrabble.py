# In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

# 1. Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.
letter_to_points = {key:value for key, value in zip(letters,points)}
print(letter_to_points)

# 2. Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.
letter_to_points[' ']= 0
print(letter_to_points)

# 3. We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.
# Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.
# Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total and set it to 0.
# After defining point_total, create a for loop that goes through the letters in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total. 
# You should get the point value from the letter_to_points dictionary. If the letter you are checking for is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.
# After the for loop is finished, return point_total.

def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for i in word:
    point_total += letter_to_points.get(i,0)
  return point_total


# Letâ€™s test this function! Create a variable called brownie_points and set it equal to the value returned by the score_word() function with an input of "BROWNIE".
# We expect the word BROWNIE to earn 15 points
brownie_points = score_word("BROWNIE")
print(brownie_points)
