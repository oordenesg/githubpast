# We are building a music streaming service. We have provided two lists, representing songs in a userâ€™s library and the amount of times each song has been played.
# Using a list comprehension, create a dictionary called plays that goes through zip(songs, playcounts) and creates a song:playcount pair for each song in songs and each playcount in playcounts.
songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

zipped_plays = zip(songs,playcounts)
plays = {songs:playcounts for songs,playcounts in zipped_plays}
